@chapter Introduction to Bibliosoph

Bibliosoph is a free and open-source technical reports manager powered by the
powerful @uref{http://cakephp.org, CakePHP framework}. It's main features allow
grouping of papers written by the same authors under various aliases (ex: Smith,
John E. writes papers under the names "John Edwin Smith", "Smith, J." and "J. E.
Smith"), easy upload of the technical reports in PDF and PS format, the
generation of BibTeX entries, sorting of papers, authors and aliases according
to various criterion and a password protected admin interface.

@chapter Installing Bibliosoph

To install Bibliosoph, you'll need to have a SQL server supported by CakePHP
(Bibliosoph has only been tested on MySQL, your mileage may vary with other
servers), a webserver with PHP support such as Apache and CakePHP installed.

@section Installing CakePHP

This installation will have Bibliosoph serve techreports from
@file{http://www.domain.tld/}. Start by downloading CakePHP from their
@uref{http://cakephp.org, website}. At the time of this writing, the latest
CakePHP version is 1.2.8.8284. 

@smallexample

@section Installing and configuring Biblisoph

Download the Bibliosoph source code. You may do this by downloading the latest
stable tarball from the Bibliosoph's web page on Github
(@uref{http://github.com/ryanakca/Bibliosoph/tree/master}) or if you're feeling
adventurous, you can get the latest development code by running @command{git
clone git://github.com/ryanakca/bibliosoph.git}.

The downloaded directory needs to be renamed to
@file{/var/www/cake/bibliosoph/}.

@smallexample
www-data@@www:/var/www$ cd cake
www-data@@www:/var/www/cake$ git clone git://github.com/ryanakca/bibliosoph.git

www-data@@www:/var/www/cake$ cd  bibliosoph
www-data@@www:/var/www/cake/bibliosoph$
@end smallexample

You will now need to create the database tell bibliosoph about it. Create a user
and a database and create the tables using the 'create_database.sql' file.

@smallexample
www-data@@www:/var/www/cake/bibliosoph$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 58
Server version: 5.1.37-1ubuntu2 (Ubuntu)

Type `help;' or `\h' for help. Type `\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> create database bibliosoph;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL ON bibliosoph.* TO 'bibliosoph'@@'localhost'
    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'bibliosoph_password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> quit
Bye
www-data@@www:/var/www/cake/bibliosoph$ mysql -u bibliosoph -p bibliosoph \
 create_database.sql
Enter password: (Enter the database password here)
www-data@@www:/var/www/cake/bibliosoph$ cp config/database.php.default \
 c\onfig/database.php
@end smallexample

Now fill in the @var{$default} array in @file{config/database.php} with your
database information.

You also need to copy @file{config/core.php.default} to @file{config/core.php}.
Modify the settings to your liking and ensure that you change the value of
@code{Security.salt} on the @code{Configure::write('Security.salt', '....');}
line to something random and different from the default. This value will be the
salt used when hashing passwords when adding and removing users.

You now need to set your webserver's document root to Bibliosoph's webroot,
@file{/var/www/cake/bibliosoph/webroot} in this installation. For Apache, look
for a line that starts with @code{DocumentRoot} in your configurations. You also
need to enable mod_rewrite. If using Apache, you can do this by running
@command{a2enmond rewrite}. Restart your webserver.

Set the variables in @file{config/bibliosoph-settings.php}. They include your
institution name and your address. These variables will be used to generate the
BibTeX entries and will be used as part of the theme.

Finally, you will need to create an administrative user to manage the site. You
may do this by using @uref{http://springenwerk.com/, Johannes Fahrenkrug's}
create_user CakePHP shell script. There is no default user to ensure that nobody
compromises a partially configured site.

@smallexample

@chapter Administering Bibliosoph

The Bibliosoph administration panel aims to make adding, editing and removing
authors, aliases, papers, uploads and users as easy as possible. This chapter
will discuss the general layout of the administrative interface, general work
flow and go into further detail of each panel of the admin interface. However,
first a few definitions are in place.

@deftp Model Author Aliases, first name, initial, last name, homepage, email
An @code{Author} is a model that represents a group of @code{Aliases} along with
information regarding the @code{Author}, such as the author's @var{first name},
@var{initial}, @var{last name}, @var{homepage} and @var{email}. An @code{Author}
may have multiple @code{Aliases}.
@end deftp

@deftp Model Alias Author, Papers, name
An @code{Alias} is a model that represents an @code{Author} as they appear on
the technical report and can be associated with multiple @code{Paper} objects.
It is for this reason that an @code{Alias} only has a @var{name} field instead
of @var{last name}, @var{first name} and @var{initial} since some authors may
submit a paper under ``John E. Smith'' once,  ``Smith, John'' another time and
then finally under ``John Edwin Smith''. The layout of the name is important
when citing.
@end deftp

@deftp Model Paper Aliases, Pdf, Ps, tr-id, title, published on, pages, display
A @code{Paper} is a technical report associated with at least on @code{Alias}
and possibly with an @code{Upload}. Each @code{Paper} has a unique
@acronym{@var{tr-id}, Technical Report ID}, a @var{title}, the date that it was
@var{published on}, a number of @var{pages}, and a boolean @var{display} field
which lets Bibliosoph know wether or not to publicly display the technical
report.
@end deftp

@deftp Model Upload Paper, name, type, size
An @code{Upload} is an uploaded file, either in @acronym{PDF, Portable Document
Format} or in @acronym{PS, PostScript} format associated to a @code{Paper}. This
file gets uploaded to @file{/files/} on the webserver, or @file{webroot/files/}
in the Bibliosoph source. The @var{name} is the file name, it gets automatically
renamed to the @code{Paper}'s @var{tr-id} while keeping it's original suffix.
@end deftp

@deftp Model User username, password
A @code{User} is a user with full access to the administrative interface. This
user is identified by a @var{username} and a @var{password}. The password is
prefixed by the value of @code{Security.salt} in @file{config/core.php} and
their @code{SHA-1 hash} is calculated and stored in the database.

@node Administrative Interface Layout, Authors, , Administering Bibliosoph
@section Administrative Interface Layout

The administrative interface is divided into five main views:

@menu
* Model Index::
* Add::
* Edit::
* View::
* Delete::
@end menu

@node Model Index, , , Administrative Interface Layout
@subsection Model Index

The model index allows you to quickly browse through the available entries for
each model. Clicking on a column's headers on the table will often allow you to
sort entries in ascending order. Clicking the same header will sort the entries
in decreasing order. Each row also has links to @code{Action} items, allowing
you to @code{Edit}, @code{View} or @code{Delete} an entry. Not all of the action
entries are available for each model. There are also links to the other models
from the bottom of the model index.

@node Add, Edit, Model Index, Administrative Interface Layout
@subsection Add

Adding a new entry to a model is done by selecting the @code{New <MODEL>} link at
the bottom of the model's index page. The administrator will be brought to a
page with a form, where required fields are in bold.

@node Edit, View, Add, Administrative Interface Layout
@subsection Edit

Editing an entry is done by selecting the @code{Edit} action item from model
entry's @code{View} page or from the model entry's row on the @code{Model
Index} page. The page will be identical to the model's @code{Add} except that
the fields will be prepopulated with the current values.

@node View, Delete, Edit, Administrative Interface Layout
@subsection View

Viewing an entry is done by selecting the @code{View} action item from the model
entry's row on the @code{Model Index} page. From here, the administrator may
view information that might not be displayed on the @code{Model Index} page due
to space constraints. The @code{View} page also allows the administrator to view
models that this entry is associated with, for example, on an @code{Author}'s
@code{View} page, the administrator may view associated @code{Aliases}.

@node Delete, , View, Administrative Interface Layout
@subsection Delete

Deleting an entry is done by selecting the @code{Delete} action item from the
model entry's row on the @code{Model Index} page, from its @code{View} page or
even from its @code{Edit} page. The administrator will be prompted with a dialog
box, asking if they really want to delete the model entry, and if the accept,
the model entry will be permanently deleted.

A basic knowledge of PHP is required to be able to hack on Bibliosoph. A general
knowledge of the CakePHP is also useful. CakePHP has extensive documentation
available on their @uref{http://www.cakephp.org, website}. One must also be
familiar with the @acronym{MVC, Model-View-Controller} architectural pattern.
